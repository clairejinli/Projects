<title>First Project</title>

<body>
    <p>Few things I enjoy doing are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Watching TV</li>
        <li>Finding the best Asian Restaurants in town</li>
        <li>Singing in the car</li>
        <li>Having deep talks with my friends about life</li>
    </ul>

   <p>I enjoy spending time alone but I also like to connect with others and have deep conversations. It's very hard to do that when everything has changed due to COVID. I saw a lot of negative changes but something I really like about technology is that it keeps evolving and with more people out there learning code, there will be more ways to connect with people around the world.</p>
